<div id="terms" class="reveal-modal" data-reveal>
  <p class="lead">Terms & Condictions.</p>
  <p>1) DEFINITIONS<br>
“Goods” means any goods and/or services provided by the Company as ordered by the Client
“ Company” means Sample Answers Ltd. incorporating Prime Prospects.
“ Client” means the person, firm or company placing an order with the Company..</p>
<p>2) APPLICATION<br>
These terms and conditions apply to any provision of services or materials by the Company to the Client.</p>
<p>3) FORMATION OF CONTRACT<br>
All Goods sold by the Company are sold subject to the Company’s standard terms and conditions (as detailed below) which form part of the Client’s contract with the Company. Terms and conditions on the Client’s order form or other similar document shall not be binding on the Company.</p>
<p>4) QUOTATIONS<br>
The prices, quantities and delivery time stated in any quotation are not binding on the Company. They are commercial estimates only which the Company will make reasonable efforts to achieve.</p>
<p>5) ORDERS<br>
5.1 Orders will be deemed to have been placed when an email confirmation has been received from a responsible executive of the client company.<br>
5.2 For email invitations, online fulfilment projects and direct marketing files (as provided by Prime Prospects) it is a requirement of the Company, that the email piece, online form or mail piece shall be approved by the company before an order can be confirmed and any data despatched.</p>
<p>6) TIMETABLE<br>
The Company will use its best endeavours to supply the services or materials within the quoted time (normally within a maximum of seven days from order or otherwise as agreed) but time will not be of the essence within the contract.
</p>
<p>7) PAYMENTS<br>
7.1 New clients or other clients out of terms may be expected to pay in advance for their services.<br>
7.2 All other invoices issued by the Company shall be paid by the Client within thirty (30) days of the date of invoice unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Company. In the event of late payment, the Company may charge interest on the amount outstanding before and after judgement at the rate of five (5) percent above the Base Rate of Barclays Bank plc in force from the due date until the date of payment. In addition, invoices unpaid for more than 60 days after the invoice date will incur a surcharge of either £30 or 5% of the outstanding amount, whichever sum is greater.<br>
7.3 If any amount of an invoice is disputed then the Client shall inform the Company of the grounds for such dispute within seven days of delivery of the goods and shall pay to the Company the value of the invoice less the disputed amount in accordance with these payment terms. Once settlement of the dispute has been agreed, any sum then outstanding shall also be payable in accordance with these payment terms.<br>
7.4 The Company reserves the right to increase a quoted fee in the event that the client requests a variation to the work agreed.</p>
<p>8) CANCELLATION<br>
In view of the nature of the service, any order – once confirmed by the Company – is not cancellable. Cancellation of the Order by the Client will only be accepted on condition that any costs, charges and expenses already incurred, including any charges that will be levied by a sub-contractor on account of their expenses, work or cancellation conditions will be reimbursed to the Company forthwith.
</p>
<p>9) DELIVERY<br>
9.1 The majority of services as supplied by the company are despatched electronically by email and shall be deemed as having been delivered when the email has been opened by the client.<br>
9.2 The Company reserves the right to substitute conventional delivery methods without notice or penalty should electronic despatch prove inconvenient; in which case delivery by the Company will be deemed to have taken place when the materials are handed to the custody of the Client at his premises or to a deputed messenger or courier when posted. The Company will be entitled to charge the Client for any expenses of delivery other than normal postage charges.</p>
